# GifTastic-App

Welcome to the GifTastic app! The GifTastic app is an interface users can use to access the GIPHY API. Users have a freedom of topic choices and can add any topic to the app. When users click on a topic button, the app will grab 10 gif images from the GIPHY API related to the topic. When users click on a GIPHY image, it will animate or pause accordingly. Have a GifTastic time!
